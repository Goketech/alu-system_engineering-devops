# alu-system_engineering-devops

Repository of teaching and automation artifacts used by the ALU System Engineering / DevOps course.

This repo collects small hands-on examples, Puppet manifests, and helper scripts for managing SSH configuration and keys used in the course.

## Repository layout

- `ssh/` — examples and Puppet code for SSH configuration and key management (see `ssh/README.md`).

## Quick start

1. Browse the folders to find the lab or lesson you want to run.
2. Read the relevant `README.md` in each folder for usage notes and safety instructions.
3. Do not commit private keys or credentials to this repository. Always use `git` with care and check `.gitignore` before adding files.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome. Typical workflow:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch for your changes.
3. Open a PR with a clear description and any test instructions.

Keep changes small and focused. If you add real code that runs (scripts, manifests), include a short example or a test harness.
